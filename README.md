# 1st-Semester-Project
Virtual Arcade

This project is a C++-based Virtual Arcade that i along with my group members developed in our first semester. It has four interactive games: Number Guessing, Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and a Quiz Game. The program allows users to select their preferred game from a menu and provides an engaging experience with real-time input validation, randomized elements, and multiplayer support for some games. The Rock-Paper-Scissors game even includes a hidden input feature for multiplayer mode. We tried to keep the code simple yet efficient using C++ programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays while offering an enjoyable gaming experience.
